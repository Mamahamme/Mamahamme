Today was my first day. 
Actually I knew algorithm. 
I knew because I was a student at 42Istanbul (Ecole42). 
I studied Hello World, Comment Lines, Escape Sequences and Variables.
Tomorrow, I will study more data types.

I had to take a break from my studies because I got sick. 
Today I continue working from where I left off because I feel better.


I studied Accept User Input, Aritmetic Operators, Augmented Assignment Operators, Constant, 
Format Specifiers, More Data Types and some Useful Math Functions.

Today I studied If Statements, Switches, Logical Operators (and, or, not).
